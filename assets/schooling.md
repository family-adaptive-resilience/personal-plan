# A Roadmap to Adaptive Schooling Choices

## Why home school?
<details>
<summary>Expand to read</summary>

### Key considerations
One of the primary drivers of increased home schooling in western societies is the long-term decline in education standards. Concerns about grade inflation have been an ever-present in recent decades as school exam results have improved year-on-year and the proportion of university degrees attracting the top grade has increased from around 15% at the end of the last century to [40% today](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/02/05/russell-group-university-awards-firsts-half-degrees-first-time/).

This intersects with two dynamics that have become important so far in 2020: the risk posed by COVID-19, and the accelerated shift to remote working. With respect to the former, further detail is set out below but it is worth noting that the risk posed by schools is not just to children, but is also indirectly to their families and friends. And that risk is not binary: it is not a case of dying or recovering from a flu-like illness - the risk of [long term health consequences](04-long_covid.md) appears to be meaningful, perhaps even for children. Governments are pushing to open schools based on balancing the increased health risks that this entails (and which they have under-represented) with, on the one hand the perceived economic benefits of allowing parents to return to work, and on the other the concerns about the effect on inequality. Since the start of the year many such bureaucratic decisions have turned out very poorly indeed.

With respect to remote working, the shift had begun prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has been greatly accelerated by it. This is important because remote working allows parents not to be tied to living in expensive urban areas where space is at a premium. As the demand for more suburban and rural locations increases, so the existing supply of school places will increasingly fail to meet demand. This may well exacerbate the problem of falling education standards leaving home schooling as an attractive option for those who want a high standard of education but do not want their children to go to boarding school.

### Won't everything go back to normal next year?
The number of home schooled children has risen [significantly](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2019/02/04/number-home-schooled-children-doubles-four-yearschildrens-commissioner/) in recent years, but 2020 has seen the trend turbo-charged with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020 in the UK, fully [87% of parents](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritain/apriltojune2020) said they had a child who was home schooled, with almost all the increase being children who learned remotely or were taught by parents.

This is a game changer. Firstly, the tools developed during this time mean that it will become now far easier to make the choice. Many parents across the globe now have direct experience of home schooling and have already had to meet and overcome many of the challenges presented. Anecdotal reports suggest some children learned far more at home than at school. The barriers to parents choosing this path have fallen significantly.

Secondly, the experience of New Orleans post hurricane [Katarina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) is instructive. Education facilities had to be rebuilt and restructured to meet population changes in the years after the hurricane and a number of the changes that had initially been imposed by necessity [ended up sticking](as a number of the changes that had initially been imposed by necessity ended up sticking in the longer term) in the longer term. The pattern of what is initially considered a short-term accommodation turning out to have long-term consequences is one that is actually quite common. This may well be similar post COVID-19 as adaptive responses both turn out to be preferable to pre-COVID approaches, but also because it becomes the new normal.

### COVID-19 risks
As of the start of September 2020, no one knows exactly what the risks are to children of COVID-19 and of schools reopening in the autumn season. There is limited research to help guide decision makers, and while the future remains unknown, the observable effects of children from poorer backgrounds falling behind in their school work, and of economic damage from parents having to stay at home, have already become obvious to policy makers. Children tend to experience milder disease than adults and have lower death rates. They also appear to have a lower chance of getting infected than adults. This has led to a widespread view that it's fine for children to catch the virus and that opening schools will have little effect on the spread of the virus. One public health official in the UK explained it thus: a child is more likely to be hit by a bus than die from COVID-19.

However, this way of thinking misses the point as it conflates lower risk with no risk, and absence of evidence with evidence of absence. Children can and do get very sick with COVID-19, they do suffer [long-term health effects](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/10/health/children-long-covid-symptoms-intl-gbr/index.html), and they can pass the virus on to family members for whom the risk of [long covid](04-long_covid.md) may be around 1:10. There are multiple examples from different countries of schools contributing to the spread of the virus. Israel was one of the first countries to start opening school again and the [process did not go so well](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/coronavirus-israel-schools-reopen.html).

> Confident it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire student body back in late May.
> Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school, which quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single school in Israel, possibly the world.
> The virus rippled out to the students’ homes and then to other schools and neighborhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives.
> Other outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close. Across the country, tens of thousands of students and teachers were quarantined.

[Endcoronavirus.org](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/schools) has some [excellent resources](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/papers/a-brief-cautionary-note-on-opening-schools) including a case study of the Israeli experience. Other countries, including [Germany, Spain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/21/coronavirus-iurope-dozens-schools-report-infections-berlin-germany-spain) and the [USA](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/14/school-reopenings-covid-19-coronavirus-us), have also seen outbreaks as schools reopen. It is a distinct possiblity that schools could play a significant role in spreading the epidemic and that children may be an important factor in spreading the virus within their familes, particularly to older and more vulnerable people.

> "This pediatrician's license to practice should be revoked for publishing this rubbish [which] ignores the age-old understanding that children DRIVE PANDEMICS #COVID19" [Prof. Vincent Racaniello](https://twitter.com/profvrr/status/1293684727879278592)

In a recent [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952), researchers in the US found that under-5s have nasopharyngeal viral loads 10-100x that of adults, while older children have similar viral loads to adults. Because children are more likely to be asymptomatic than adults, it may be easier for them to spread the virus, meaning that as children return to school there is a material risk of them unknowingly passing the virus to their family members who in turn can pass it on at work.

The problem remains that: the role children play is not yet well-understood; in past pandemics children were important drivers of viral transmission; there is evidence that children have similar or higher viral loads than adults in their respiratory tracts; and there have been numerous school outbreaks in different geographies. As long as COVID-19 cases remain in any given area, and until transmission dynamics are better understood, it would be wise to consider the risk of returning children in those areas to school and the increased risk to everyone else of interacting with those parents whose children have returned to school, particularly in areas of high prevalence. The risk and uncertainty have led some parents to consider home schooling, and this is more visible amongst those who tend to be early adopters of new ideas and technology.

### [Silicon Valley Bets Big on Microschools and Pods](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-23/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-microschools-and-pods)

"As working parents in the U.S. stare down another semester of classroom-free chaos, tech companies are hustling to fill what seems to be a bottomless demand for child-minding solutions, with platforms for pod-seeking families, daycare providers, and options to form what are sometimes known as “microschools.” The loose umbrella term refers to what are generally very small clusters of students, led by parents or educators following pedagogies and operational structures as an alternative to public education. Known for smaller class sizes, flexible schedules, and alternative learning methods, pre-Covid examples of microschools range from Montessori-style programs that equip a handful of students with personalized curricula from infancy to middle school, to outdoor “forest schools” where kindergarteners learn through exploration at parks and beaches."

## How to home school
<details>
<summary>Expand to read</summary>

### Can you home school?
Home schooling is legal in most developed nations. The countries with the most home schooled children are the USA, Canada, South Africa, UK, Australia, Poland and Chile. Notable exceptions where home schooling is not legal are Germany, the Netherlands and much of Eastern Europe. Wikipedia has a [useful list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_international_status_and_statistics) of the status of home schooling in different countries. It notes that in Hong Kong home schooling is legal, although many believe it to be otherwise. The law in England requries that children over 5 years old are educated, but not that they attend school; they can be educated at home and there is no requirement to follow any specific curriculum.

### Removing a child from school in the UK
If your child is registered at a school you should inform the school that you are removing your child. The school does not have to approve of your decision and does not play a part in your decision. There are templates available at some of the websites listed below, for example [here](https://www.educationotherwise.org/index.php/deregistration). If your child has yet to be registered at a school then there is no notification necessary.

### Practical considerations
#### Number of children
For a single family there is no limit to the number of children who can be educated together, nor is there a limit if a parent of ech child is present. However, if more than one family educates their children together, and if the parents are not all present, then it is important to stay within the legal limites to avoid having to register as a school. The requirement is that if there are 4 children or fewer, then they can be eduated together without a time limit. For 5 or more children there is an 18 hour per week limit. [NB - this still need to be confirmed for sure as it isn't 100% clear]

#### Location
The legal requirement is that the education takes place at home. As long as the household used belongs to the family of one of the children being educated then this is fine. Problems arise when a separate facility is rented for the purposes of education. Many home schoolers recommend setting aside a dedicated room in the house for lessons.

#### Who can teach or supervise them?
There is no requirement for a specific individual to supervise them, so this could be the responsibility of one or more of the parents, of an outside tutor or of another individual employed for that purpose, for example a nanny.

#### Sports and social activities
Many home educators meet up with others for social and sporting activities. There are multiple Facebook groups set up for this purpose, for exmaple [this one](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HEUKForum/) in the UK. There are also now some online resources, such as [this popular YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebodycoach1/search?query=kids). Research suggests that the transition can be more difficult for older children who are used to lots of social interaction with friends, so this may be an important focus.

#### Syllabus
In the UK there is no requirement to follow a specific syllabus. All that is necesary is that the child be enagaged in full time educaiton and that they attain a satisfactory level of numeracy and literacy. More information can be found, among other sources, on the gov.uk website - [Guidance for parents](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/791528/EHE_guidance_for_parentsafterconsultationv2.2.pdf) and via the links below.

### Finding tutors and others
One option is for parents to educate their children. However, [a study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritain/apriltojune2020) in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that 77% of parents found the greatest barrier to effective home schooling was the parents themselves - they lacked motivation. 

Consider [direct instruciton](https://tophat.com/glossary/d/direct-instruction/) as a key method of education:

>Direct instruction is where teachers use explicit teaching techniques to teach a specific skill to their students. This type of instruction is teacher-directed, where a teacher typically stands at the front of a room and presents information. Teachers match their instruction to the task to enhance students’ understanding of a topic. This technique depends on strict lesson plans with little room for variation. It does not include active learning activities such as discussions, workshops or case studies.

In addition, research shows that children learn better with an individual than just with computer-based resources. Thus, hiring a tutor could be a good idea. They may be in increasing demand, so it is worth acting on this as soon as possible. Some resources below:

- [Tutor Hunt](https://www.tutorhunt.com/)
- For the UK, Education Otherwise [links to organisations providing nationwide access to tutorial services](https://www.educationotherwise.org/index.php/links/33-tutors-and-tuition)
- [Superprof](https://www.superprof.co.uk/)
- Nanny agencies such as [Eden Private Staff](https://www.edenprivatestaff.com/what-we-do/nannies) and [Norland Nannies](https://www.norland.ac.uk/) are one option. Another is to find a nanny directly, for example via websites such as [www.childcare.co.uk](https://www.childcare.co.uk/)

### Other considerations
Ensure there is sufficient IT equipment for all of the children.
